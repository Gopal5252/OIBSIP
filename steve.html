                About the Steve Jobs
            </h1>

            

<p>
                ☛ Among all business leaders in recent times, 
                Steve Jobs is arguably the best example of the fact that perseverance commands success. 
                <br><br>
                
                ☛ Steve Jobs was considered a difficult boss at Apple before he was ousted but when he returned, 
                there was little change in his leadership style. 
                <br><br>
                ☛This demonstrates that Jobs always remained true to himself whether others approved of his leadership style or not. 
                Jobs might not have been a likeable person on a personal level but he was authentic.
                <br><br>
                
                ☛Even though we often hear about the virtues of democratic leadership style 
                as it motivates employees and improves communication between leaders and subordinates, 
                Jobs ruled in an autocratic manner.
                <br><br>
                
                ☛ No wonder, Fortune magazine called him one of the leading egomaniacs in the Silicon Valley (Williams, 2012).
                <br><br>
               
                ☛  When Jobs started his second term at Apple, he was not happy with one of the shipping company. 
                He asked them to be faster with delivery but they refused since their service was already in 
                accordance with the agreed upon terms. 
                <br><br> 
                
                ☛ He directed his manager to break the contract despite manager’s objection that it would lead to 
                costly lawsuit which did happen eventually (Austen, 2012). Author Andrew Keen wrote in his book 
                The Cult of the Amateur that there is not an ounce of democracy at Apple and without Jobs’
                authoritarian leadership, Apple would be just another Silicon Valley outfit (Chaudhuri, 2012). 
                <br><br> 
                
                ☛ Jobs would be involved in all the details and hired like-minded people (Branson, 2011).
                 But he still drew admiration because he personally demonstrated what he said. He didn’t 
                 only preach innovation but practiced it himself.

                <br><br> 
                
                ☛ Steve Jobs also subscribed to Herzberg’s ‘Theory X’ according to which workers are lazy and 
                need guidance. This should not imply that Apple’s employees were lazy and incapable but only 
                that Jobs’ approach reflected his pursuit for perfection. 
                <br><br> 
                
                ☛Jobs often reiterated that Apple’s mission was to build the best products in the industries 
                it competes in. This is he micromanaged his employees and no product left the company’s 
                door without his approval.
                <br><br> 
                
                ☛ Steve Jobs was also a transformational leader. When he re-joined the company,
                Apple was waiting to join the list of extinct companies (Chakrabortty, 2011). 
                Jobs didn’t only save the company but also made it into one of the most admired companies,
                with a loyal customer base that most other companies only dream of. 
                Jobs’ subordinates believed in him because they knew he was passionate about 
                the company and the products it delivered to the market.
                <br><br> 
                
                ☛They also witnessed Jobs’ obsession with quality and, 
                thus, became motivated themselves to deliver the best products to consumers.
                <br><br> 
                
                ☛ Steve Jobs was not afraid to think outside the box and he encouraged his 
                subordinates to do the same. In fact, the company’s original motto was “Think Different”. 
                Steve Jobs was not only transformational but also visionary.
                <br><br> 
                
                ☛ Effective leaders scan the external environment to look for emerging trends but Jobs 
                told the consumers what the trends should be (Verganti, 2011). He singlehandedly redefined 
                several industries including smart phones, portable music players, and tablet computing.
